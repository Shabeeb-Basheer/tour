At night this place is lit with lights surrounding the entire property. We enjoyed bonfire and barbecue as well. Less number of occupants was also a plus point. Infact, for two days me and my wife were the only guest. You are with the nature at this place, lots of birds always to accompany you around. For two days we did nothing in Ooty, just stayed at this beautiful place, observed the nature and observed ourself. We also went for cycling around the place. Not to forget the best part of our stay was the hospitality of the caretaker Aamir and the cook who cooks some really delicious food, very very caring and a joy to be around with.
